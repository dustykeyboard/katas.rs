# Katas

Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development.

These katas are implemented using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

The first kata is an exploration into generating and solving sudoku puzzles, and was used to build familiarisation with basic rust syntax, looping, references and also reading and writing to the filesystem.
